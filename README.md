# randomizergame
This is a game i made using the pygame and perlin libraries to try and make a passive background party game.
the hope is to make a slow betting game to last a long time, the team plays is by spending its money, either in their army, or in their economy
by buying banks the player recieves more money per round, and by buying power it increases the chance that your team will win its atack.
but since this was a very simple concept i decided to also add an enviorment where there are two types of obsticles, walls which take 3 rounds to break
and gold mines which give the team 100 monies.
the enviorment is generated using the perlin library, and the hole game displayed using pygame
MENU:
to navigate the menu you can select the input box, and introduce the size of the board, which has to be bigger than 10,
and while it is capable i dont recomend running above 150,but it is capable, the largest amount i managed is 1000, but it took a while to load and was very slow.
CONTROLS:
to PLAY the game you have to press RETURN or ENTER on your keyboard, it will read the input box, only if it is bigger than 10, else it will take the standard value of 90
PLAYING:
to play the red team has two inputs on the keyboard:
A: which places banks
and
S: which places powerunits
and the BLUE TEAM also has two inputs on the keyboard:
K: which places banks
and
L: which places powerunits
EXTRA:
to Quit the game press the red X on pygame
to exit to menu press ESC key on your keyboard
to reload the map<"WARNING THIS WILL RESET THE GAME"> press the RETURN key while the game is in session.


FUTURE PLANS:
Honestly i plan to leave this project as it is, maybe i will add phone conection to play with many players and free the players off the keyboard, feel free to change the code.

have fun and feel free to scooby doo what you gotta scooby dooby doo
